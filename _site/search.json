    "text": "Liz Truss said she was comfortable taking unpopular decisions. For the general public, this “fiscal event” may not, yet, prove unpopular, but it may prove controversial or even courageous.\nTo produce a multi-billion pound stimulus package at a time of high inflation may be controversial. That it is wholly unfunded at a time of rapidly rising interest rates may be courageous.\nAs Sir Humphrey Appleby said, “Controversial” only means “this will lose you votes”. “Courageous” means “this will lose you the election”!\nThat the Chancellor’s actions have both weakened Sterling (causing higher inflation) and increased gilt yields (increasing the cost of borrowing) still further would have even Sir Humphrey grasping for euphemisms.\nThe Chancellor is betting the house on a suite of measures which are unlikely to deliver what is being asked of them. There is little to no evidence that the rates of tax in the UK form any substantive barrier to increasing the long term trend growth rate of the economy.\nThe scale of unfunded borrowing announced today is, by any measure, extremely high.\nReducing the basic rate of income tax, and abolishing the additional rate, alongside reversing the increase in national insurance contributions and cancelling the increase in corporation tax will, collectively, cost the public finances £45bn a year by 2024.\nWith other announced measures adding an additional £72bn to the deficit (now expected to be £234bn, over 10% of GDP) at a time when the two-year cost of government borrowing has increased from 0.4% to 3.9% over the past year will cost even more.\nAdding this additional unfunded borrowing will increase those rates further still, compounding the problem.\nThe scale of the effective stimulus is likely to cause the Bank of England’s MPC to increase Bank rate faster than previously expected, further increasing the cost of borrowing yet more.\nThe forward curve on Bank rate now has a 50% probability of a 100bps rise in November with peak rates next year up from 4.75% to 5.4%. This will further compound the problems that the chancellor says he wishes to solve.\nIt is painfully clear why Treasury resisted an official OBR forecast with these policies.\nThe removal of the additional rate of income tax is, in terms of cost to the Treasury, insignificant (and may actually raise revenue – NB HMT revenue is not economic growth), though its political message may be stronger.\nIn removing this band, the Chancellor points to the complexity of other OECD countries’ tax systems and how administrationally burdensome they are, whilst failing to realise that they have higher levels of productivity, higher levels of investment and stronger growth.\nIf simplifying was important, then tackling the removal of the personal allowance above £100,000 would have been a better place to start. But simplification isn’t really on the Chancellor’s agenda, as he’s also abolished the Office for Tax Simplification.\nThere is much confusion in the chancellor’s statement, saying that we need to increase the number of people in work, but he is tackling part-time workers rather than the huge increase in economic inactivity of the past few years.\nThat will only be supported by investment into health which will enable people not working for health reasons to return to the labour market, but the money for this is no longer available after a swathe of tax cuts.\nStamp duty is a tax which the majority of economists agree is unhelpful and its reduction is a good thing in and of itself: it makes little sense to tax people moving home.\nHowever, this tax operates in highly-constrained market with insufficient new homes being built and housing remaining an under taxed asset with little to pay in direct relation to its value, and particularly its ultimately unproductive increase.\nThe cut in stamp duty is likely to be capitalised into house values, meaning there will be little to no overall change in house prices.\nHowever, the increase in values will now, for many, fall into their mortgages at a time when interest rates are rising sharply which in turn will reduce households’ disposable income over the longer term.\nCorporation tax reforms fail to understand the interaction between headline rate and the base. A £1m per year capital allowance is maintained, but reducing the rate relatively disincentivises investment compared to a higher rate.\nThere is too much focus on the headline rate, and not enough attention to how the base and reliefs affect behaviour.\nIf government truly wanted to incentivise investment (and ultimately, its lack is the fundamental barrier to growth in the UK economy), then allowances would be increased both significantly and permanently, and the corporation tax rate would be increased.\nThis would strongly incentivise companies to invest with only retained profits taxed at a higher rate.\nIf this package were to increase the trend rate of growth to 2.5%, then there is an outside chance that these changes may pay for themselves. But there is no substantial body of economic evidence to suggest that they will.\nOverall this package is, on balance, more likely to increase the challenges to the UK economy over the medium term, even if it results in a politically helpful short-term stimulus before the next election.\nThe short-termism of UK politics is writ large in this statement, but the costs are here for the long-term."

    "text": "I remember my interest in this being piqued at the time the Edinburgh Fringe was beginning but a combination of deadlines and some holiday meant that it slipped my mind. But, coming back to work and clearing out the inbox, I stumbled on this piece in the FT.\n\n\n\nVisitors give money to local business, but not to the local government\n\n\nThe pressures on popular tourist cities from ‘over-tourism’ are well known (see a piece in CityMetric from earlier today), these often focus on the impact on local residents in terms of changing natures of their town or city centres (increases in businesses that are dominantly tourist-focused such as bars, souvenir shops, etc.), and the pressure on house prices and quality of life caused by rapidly-increasing shares of accommodation given over to temporary tourist accommodation through platforms such as Airbnb.\nThese are all very real, but I want to focus for now on the impact of large-scale tourism (and this includes one-off, large events, more prolonged festivals such as the Edinburgh fringe, or permanent tourism destinations) on local authorities, and its parallel that can also be applied to economic growth through retail or other destination-led expansion of local economies.\nI’m interested in this angle because I see it as a small part of a much larger problem within the UK’s centralised economic and political structures, but particularly through its Westminster-driven fiscal policies. Much has been written elsewhere (and I’ll contribute more to this literature myself) on the lack of fiscal devolution in the UK, with local authorities raising only a small share of their incomes and having genuinely direct influence over the spending of an even smaller part.\nEven with recent committed reforms to local government finance and the retention of business rates (see my publications section for the weeks of my life I’ve lost to this cause), local government is able to capture very little uplift of any growth in its area. However, there is at least a (theoretical) ability to capture some of the increase in large-scale commercial developments whilst not incurring much – or any – of the cost of delivering it.\nBut with tourism, and particularly with events-related tourism, there can be costs to bear. As Edinburgh City Council noted in the run-up to the Fringe, the city bears additional costs in terms of street cleansing and other associated activities in terms of managing the enormous increase in the number of visitors, but isn’t able to fiscally capture the benefits. There are spill-over benefits, of course: businesses see more trade, the city increases its profile (which can, of course attract more tourists, bringing more costs and benefits with it), but the critical point is that the city corporation – the local public budgets – see none of this uplift.\nThe call then, from an SNP-member, is for a tourist tax to both raise revenue and to perhaps soften demand for tourist-led temporary accommodation of short-term lets. These, usually in the form of bed taxes, a fixed levy on the number of person-nights stayed are common in other countries and have an advantage over other taxes by being payed mostly by people who, by definition, don’t live in the area. Because every supplier of bed-nights to visitors would come into scope (but only if the regulation of Airbnb and other types of resident or property-owner lets can be delivered alongside this) would be the inflationary impact would be felt sector-wide, providing little intra-sectoral competition issues.\nIn terms of its introduction, it seems that tourist taxes may be one of the more simple ways of beginning the process of tax devolution. It doesn’t impose on the traditional nationally-led taxes, and could be managed almost entirely within the collection architectures already present as part of the business rates system. There’s little to lose from a political perspective, and it would bring the UK into line with many other developed countries. And, of course, it would bring some welcome relief to the austerity that has fallen so heavily on local governments across the UK.\nThere’s a wider debate to be had, too (but not in this blog), about the benefits of charging visitors different rates than residents. This is also common in other countries: alcohol may be expensive in Sweden for holidaymakers, but a residents’ card reduces the price significantly, and other European cities offer discounts for local residents on public transport fares.\nInterestingly, London played with this concept briefly, albeit not explicitly, when it introduced the Oyster system. Londoners were quick to migrate to the contactless system as the deposit for a card was low enough to be worth it for the lower-than-cash fares that non-Oyster holders had to bear. This meant that visitors were likely to pay higher fares for using TfL’s services than local residents. But, since the wider move to direct contactless payment through bank cards, the cheaper price is now available to non-residents with a contactless card (great news for UK and many EU citizens, bad news for Americans). An interesting project would be trying to find out the lost revenue caused by an increasing share of non-cash payments, but that’s for another day.\nSo, there are benefits to tourism taxes for local governments. Increased revenues to support existing costs, and potentially a benefit for locals by helping to share the pain with visitors. It may even help Westminster by supporting local government more to self-finance. The question is who will get there first."

    "text": "My partner and I are keen city-break fans. We try and get to different places across Europe regularly, and enjoy the experience of the different histories and cultures that they provide. But, we’ve not done all that much travelling around the UK, and outside our working city of Manchester, don’t really know much of our own country well outside other northern cities (including Edinburgh, perhaps for me the UK’s most European city) and, of course, London. So, whilst the weather in the UK has been good this summer, we planned a week of travelling around the East and West Midlands.\nPerhaps the biggest and most pleasant surprise was Coventry, a city I’ve often heard remarked on as a concrete jungle. Yes, there’s lots of it, but it had a interesting feel to it, some great pubs and excellent restaurants, and an open, friendly and vibrant feel to it, and you see clearly what the planners were attempting to create in its pedestrianised centre.\nBut the places that captured my imagination the most were Lincoln and Newark. One an ancient city, seemingly surprisingly off the tourist trail (despite one of the very finest cathedrals in the UK and a fine castle and old town) and one an old market town, they struck me as being quite similar.\nThough I’ve moved around the north over the years, I consider myself foremost as a city-dweller, even though I now live in a small village in the Pennine hills, as I commute to Manchester daily and love the city passionately. A side effect of this, alongside having worked in urban economic policy for a decade, is that when visiting small towns and cities, I tend to always ask myself ‘what do people do here? How is the economy structured? How do these places survive?’.\nBut in both Lincoln and Newark, I see places that are well kept, with plenty of independent companies, relatively few empty shops, and a generally positive vibe to them. Economic research and development policy has, over the past decade, been focused on cities as the engines of growth, perhaps to the exclusion of other parts of the country, and this divide between rural and urban can be seen in party-political affiliation, the Brexit vote and other indicators. The aftermath of the financial crisis and the recession, and particularly the decision to leave the European Union, have reawakened interest in the places outside our cities, and we are now seeing some excellent research being published on towns, particularly by the new think-tank Centre for Towns.\nSo, spurred on by these thoughts (which, I’m conscious, come from a lack of experience and understanding in non-urban economies), I’ll be looking more closely at some of these in the coming days and weeks, seeking to answer my questions and to better understand how – and if – they are different to cities, and to learn about their challenges and opportunities they face in their futures.\nI’m particularly interested in those towns and cities that are not within easy striking distance (or economic capture) of major cities, as I think those that are, whilst having similar challenges, have very different policy requirements for their solutions. I’ll return to these questions and more, hopefully with some answers, soon."

    "text": "This blog was first published in the Manchester Evening News on 29 October 2013.\nRonald Wilson Reagan, 40th president of the United States from 1981 to 1989, addressing the White House Conference on Small Business in 1986, said: “Government’s view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases: if it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidise it.”\nPolicy in itself is easy enough to define (the Oxford English Dictionary describes it as “a course or principle of action adopted or proposed by an organisation or individual”), but good policy is rather harder to pin down and, even it were easily described, sadly politics all too often gets in the way.\nSince the Labour Party conference and Ed Miliband’s announcement of a price freeze on energy bills for 20 months should his party form the next government in 2015, the topic of energy prices has been intensively commented upon.\nThe past two weeks have seen two of the “big six” energy companies announce rises in their average prices and it is almost certain that the other four will follow suit over the coming few weeks.\nThe public’s frustration at rising energy prices at a time of low wage inflation is understandable and, whilst the policy message is understandably popular, it is confused at best and dangerous at worst.\n\nContrary to popular belief, energy prices did not rise after privatisation (see chart above); electricity prices stayed broadly flat for three years before falling steadily for the 10 years to 2004 by 27 per cent. Gas prices fell by 30 per cent from privatisation to their low point in late 2000.\nSince then, the picture has been very different: gas prices are now double what they were in 2005, and electricity prices are 55 per cent higher over the same time.\nWholesale prices driven by concerns over supply and the rapidly increasing global demand are part of this but government policy has played a significant part.\nLevies on the cost of energy to pay for the carbon emitted, to subsidise green energy supply and to subsidise energy-efficient retrofitting are all included in your bill, though not itemised, so you don’t see them.\nAdd into this the levies on the companies to pay for the upgrading of the infrastructure and it mounts up.\nOfgem estimates 6 per cent of gas and 11 per cent of electricity bills are government green policy driven. Another 5 per cent is VAT.\nAverage profits from the big six energy companies last year were around 5 per cent and it’s hard to argue that is excessive, particularly with the scale of investment required over the coming decade to keep the lights on, and that will come from the profits of the energy companies, profits which will be eroded by freezing the consumer price.\nGovernment policy is directly increasing the cost of energy, whether through taxes or levies or by having not invested in infrastructure so as supply certainty weakens, wholesale prices are driven higher.\nIt may be that it’s worth the extra charges for the longer term investment – you can make your own mind up about that – but what is confused is government deliberately raising the costs of energy delivery and then complaining about it.\nThey tax it, regulate it, levy additional charges on it, and then seek to subsidise it. That is madness."

    "text": "This was first published in Prospect Magazine supplement ()\nThe revenue doesn’t need to design an app. The private sector will do it anyway\nAt the Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce, we are constantly refining our ideas about infrastructure. Historically we would, of course, talk about road, rail and energy. More recently, digital has emerged as an additional strand.\nBut this approach has its challenges and, for us, reinforces a problem at the heart of government decision-making on projects: it’s too easy to focus on the project itself, and not what it aims to achieve. Big, shiny new projects give photo opportunities for ministers in high-vis vests and hardhats. But much more important are the benefits that a project offers.\nIf only government thought in this way. Perhaps then we would see more small-scale schemes with good, quick results at the margins instead of the profusion of large-scale transformative plans, with their promise of political dividends.\nSimilar problems emerge with the government’s approach to data. The UK’s official statistical body, the Office for National Statistics (ONS), has remarkable limits on its ability to access data from other government departments, something that many other countries’ agencies take for granted. While our own government’s approach is changing, and the ONS itself is making good progress in refining its product, much good work in the private sector is held back by overly-rigid interpretations of data protection law or by a lack of dynamism in agencies in publishing the data they hold.\nSome authorities are leading the way in providing dedicated data portals and being as open as they can. Working with a variety of bodies, organisations like the Open Data Institute, Data Mill North and Open Data Manchester are showing what can be done, with a genuinely open attitude to releasing as much information as possible into the public domain. This includes some excellent online tools for visualisation and mapping. Even those without the increasingly-important ability to format data in a digestible way, can begin to learn from its provision.\nBut what should be published, and how can it be used by business? The short answer is we don’t really know, and that we need to use the open market to help us discover the answer. The last few years have seen rapid progress in the data application market. Even HMRC expects that it won’t have to design apps for its making tax digital programme—private developers will do it anyway. This suggests that the more data that can be provided, and made available in an open, machine-readable format with as few restrictions as possible, the more likely we are to learn what data can be put to useful ends.\n\n“Government can help by publishing its data so that it can be more easily used by private organisations and individuals”\n\nThis presents a huge challenge for organisations in determining what resources they should put into data publication. For those with modern IT infrastructure and good business processes, the extraction of anonymised data on a large scale should be easy. But, for businesses where high-quality information is not readily collected and analysed, collating and publishing their own data will be expensive. But, overall, the number of organisations in the latter group is falling a trend that should continue as data management systems become more widely available.\nGovernment, both local and national, can help by publishing its data so that it can be more easily used by private organisations and individuals. Recent work by the Cabinet Office in its Open Standards Principles is a good starting point and should, over time, lead to significant improvements. However, it is overly focused on procurement and there is a risk that, in aiming for an all-encompassing standard, the release of data into the public domain could be delayed—the perfect becoming the enemy of the good.\nAbove all, it is leadership within organisations that will drive greater success. It will need to strike a balance between confidentiality and the willingess to publish data that is of value to the wider marketplace. This will differ from place to place. The ultimate practical uses of data may be developed in areas only remotely connected to the purpose for which the data was initially collected.\nIt’s a new world where the opportunities are not always clear. But that doesn’t mean we mustn’t, or shouldn’t, try. The future should be open."

    "text": "This piece was first published in Prospect Magazine in .\nIt’s the most popular mode of public transport—and the most ignored\nOn 4th July, when Americans were celebrating the anniversary of their independence, the parliament that centuries before had failed to represent them was questioning its prime minister. The leader of the opposition concentrated his questions on a topic missing from the PM’s folder—Britain’s bus services. Jeremy Corbyn was lampooned for choosing this obscure subject.\nTheresa May’s reply, that buses are an issue for local authorities, was wrong. While she pointed to the new powers in the Bus Services Act 2017, she failed to mention her predecessor’s Transport Act of 1985. This privatised and deregulated bus services outside London, reducing local authorities’ role to the point where all they did was write the cheque.\nThe prime minster at the time, Margaret Thatcher, suggested that those older than 26 who used buses were a failure, but, with 4.9bn bus journeys in the UK in 2016/17 compared to 1.7bn by rail, why don’t politicians take buses more seriously? Perhaps the problem is that those who set transport policy don’t use them. Our views of the world are shaped intrinsically by our own experiences. That means that transport policy tends to be set to the benefit of those who design it. And that means the experience of London-based civil servants and politicians. And that means trains.\nThe recent timetable change chaos, while inconveniencing millions, focuses only on the experience of a small share of the population. Nearly two-thirds of train journeys start or end in London, and one-third of all commutes to central London are by rail. This is not the normal experience for the rest of Britain. In Greater Manchester, cars dominate and account for 70 per cent of commutes. Even though Europe’s busiest bus corridor runs past my university campus, only 10 per cent of all journeys are by bus, and only 4 per cent by train (6 per cent if you include the Metrolink trams).\nLondon’s buses have been successful: they are regulated, have a flat fare structure, provide contactless and integrated ticketing, receive a healthy subsidy and consequently account for around half of the UK’s annual bus journeys. Even outside London, buses are more important than rail: in Greater Manchester, 80 per cent of public transport journeys are by bus, but rail gets the attention and the subsidy.\nBuses have an image problem. Outside London, the user base is overwhelmingly working class and, by definition, poor. The National Travel Survey shows that, in London, the richest fifth uses buses as much as the poorest, but in the rest of the country, the top 20 per cent make only half as many journeys as the average and two-thirds less than the poorest 40 per cent. Rail, however, is used twice as much by the wealthiest fifth than the average, and three times more than those from the bottom half of the distribution.\nThe focus on rail travel with large subsidies and the capping of season ticket costs disproportionately supports the wealthiest. Current policy gives the richest 10 per cent of households nearly twice as much transport subsidy as the poorest. Transport investments are too often focused on improving city-to-city journey times, frequencies and capacities, but this risks focusing too heavily on the needs of a small and socially distinct group of people who can afford to commute long distances into relatively well-paid city centre employment.\nBuses are a vital part of public transport, and form a critical part of social infrastructure for the poorest who often don’t own cars and rely on taxis. They could, as we see in the capital, provide a better solution for many of our growing cities. National government does not see the importance, but local governments do. England’s new mayors are now seeking to maximise the opportunities of bus regulation in their areas, but this will take time—and money, which is in short supply. But there needs to be control, and that control needs to be local.\nThe devolution revolution, heralded under George Osborne, has slowed, but increasingly this is where we must look for solutions. As in so many other areas of policy, the Westminster model continues to fail most of the country, and those powers should be given to those who can use them best."

    "text": "This blog was first published in TheBusinessDesk.com (North West) on 14 August 2017.\nLast week, the UK think-tank Centre for Cities released a report, Should we move public sector jobs out of London?, the conclusion of which was that, whilst the relocation of parts of the BBC out of London to Salford brought jobs to MediaCityUK, its wider impact on employment across Greater Manchester (GM) was limited. In terms of impact, let’s say that Centre for Cities media hits KPIs will be looking much stronger today than they were before its launch. Reaction against the report was strong across social media, with many saying that it was typical of a London-based think-tank to do the North down, or similar (and unrepeatable). It was enough to provoke even Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) to issue a press release saying it rejects the “flawed report”.\nSean Anstee, GMCA’s lead for employment and skills, and the Mayor of Salford, Paul Dennett, both stressed the positive effects seen since the BBC’s move of clustering and innovation in the creative and digital sector, and rightly highlighted the significant growth of this industry in GM over the past few years, but the chair of the GM LEP, Mike Blackburn, went further, saying “a report that says the BBC has not had a positive impact on Greater Manchester is ridiculous”.\nI agree with Mike: it would be ridiculous if a report said that, but the crucial point here is that this one doesn’t. This report, a welcome addition to the literature in this area, focuses on net employment growth, an area where previous policy-driven relocations have often fallen well short of their lofty ambitions (the National Audit Office suggested in 2013 that the BBC’s move to MediaCityUK could generate 15,000 jobs, more than twice what has been achieved there so far). But just because overly-ambitious targets are not met does not mean that there hasn’t been measurable success.\nThe Centre for Cities report highlights the jobs growth in the creative, media and digital sectors in Greater Manchester overall and that this growth has outpaced the national average in Greater Manchester; some of this is certainly due to the “BBC effect”, but is also due to Manchester’s longer-run reputation in these sectors and its increasing attractiveness as a city in which to do business in these areas. But the crux of the report is that the net job gain, the overall employment level impact, on the local economy when organisations are moved like this, is limited, and displacement can make up a large share. This is not new: the UK’s history with policy experiments like enterprise zones also shows significant amounts of displacement into these areas from others, with net gains lower than initially expected.\nBut here’s the important part from a policy wonk’s point of view: none of this contradicts the previous research, or the GMCA’s reactive press release, that shows positive wider social and economic benefits than relocations like this can produce, and it’s that “can” that’s important. Success is not, like in other areas of life, guaranteed, and certainly not in all areas. The arrival of a large body, like the BBC, can provide lots of positive benefits and spill-over effects, but these are predicated as much on the wider ability of an area to capitalise on it as they are by the move itself.\nArguably the move of the BBC into Salford was highly likely to be successful overall: a huge addition of a major national body with global reputations into a city with a strong track record for innovation, creativity and maximising opportunities would likely fare well. But this doesn’t mean that all indicators will be hugely positive, nor that all cities could pull this off equally well. Within these broader remits, it’s questionable whether, overall, a weak net employment growth in the locality really matters, but it does matter if that’s the reason for doing it in the first place.\nDebates have raged for decades in the UK about relocating jobs out of London to the regions. From Harold Wilson’s policies to place new government departments outside London and his Industrial Development Act through to more recent cases covered in this report (the Office for National Statistics’ move to Newport is also looked at and comes out even less well), it’s an area that’s had lots of policies but, in truth, few major successes. Often, this is because the policy aims are poorly designed, with more wishful thinking than tangible and achievable outcomes. The BBC wanted to promote better regional coverage and connect better with its regions: the move to MediaCityUK has helped it to achieve that, and Greater Manchester is making the most of this opportunity to maximise its own growth. This is all good news, but this report highlights that, if you’re expecting relocations like this to spur large-scale job creation in and of themselves, you’re unlikely to succeed. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t go ahead: life in policy isn’t black and white.\nAnd it’s this subtlety, and the way that the reaction to this report has tackled it so poorly, that’s the major thing we must learn from. There is no contradiction between the Centre for Cities report and the success of the sector as a whole in Greater Manchester: they’re measuring different things. From a policy design and formulation perspective, this detail is important. When leading figures come out and shout down a report for saying something it doesn’t say, it’s disappointing, particularly when Greater Manchester has shaped itself over the past decades as a rigorous evaluator of evidence-based policy.\nCentre for Cities has been working tirelessly for years on promoting the growth of the UK’s cities, the over-centralisation of the UK economy in London, and pushing forward the devolution narrative to support better, more balanced growth across the country. To say it is providing ammunition to those who want to keep power in Whitehall is dangerously oversimplifying a complex area. Yes, this report could be read that way by people whose interest it is to keep these old battles alive. For those of who want to move things forward, with challenge, evidence, and a foot on the ground, this is welcome ammunition. But we’ve got to stop firing the bullets at others who are on the same side."

    "text": "This was first published in BNY Mellon’s ‘Manchester 2025: the next decade of development’ in 2015.\nManchester’s reinvention and re-invigoration over the past decade or more has been impressive. Shrugging off its post-industrial decline, its rebirth as a modern city is clear.\nIts business heart is thriving with a large cluster of financial, legal and professional services companies and Europe’s second-largest digital and creative hub. Meanwhile, cutting-edge science, innovation and high-technology manufacturing activity are inextricably linked to the strong knowledge base present in Europe’s largest university population.\nThe city’s strength extends beyond business and includes a vibrant consumer economy, including the most extensive retail centre and busiest tourist destination outside London, and its world-leading – and rapidly-expanding – arts, culture and sport provision. It is, perhaps, this wide-ranging and comprehensive offer that has been the key to Manchester’s success.\n\n“The next 10 years will see growth come mostly from our strongest industries now”\n\nLooking forward, however, the city will face challenges, as any rapidly-growing urban economy does. This includes attracting investment in infrastructure to facilitate access to jobs and transport between homes, offices and factories. The benefits of this growth must be shared across Manchester’s growing population and there remains much work to be done in ensuring that all residents are able to take part in the future economy.\nThe proliferation of the “hour-glass” labour market will require both high- and low-level skills with fewer and fewer positions in the middle. Meanwhile, a growing population will need somewhere to live, a problem that is increasingly being shown to be unsolvable by our current housing, planning, construction and financial systems.\nThe next 10 years will see growth come mostly from our strongest industries now: professional services, creative and media, advanced manufacturing, energy, logistics, arts and culture and retail, with education and health both growing in importance in response to the demands for a skilled workforce and the challenges of an ageing one.\nBut if history teaches us anything, it is that Manchester’s strengths are its resilience and ingenuity. Economic forecasting makes clear that our ability to predict the future is poor, and that it is managing and responding to change, rather than foreseeing it, that allows us to best capitalise on the opportunities that Manchester in 2025 will give us.\nWe may not know what it will look like in the future, but Manchester will thrive."

Whilst we’ve seen a strong recovery since the middle of 2013, some high streets are still showing signs of considerable distress. However, the problems go beyond macro-economics and are more to do with a changing culture. People’s expectations have changed, and not all towns have yet understood, or been able to respond to, the change in customers’ habits."

    "text": "The bad guys\nBusiness rates, parking charges, out-of-town centres and the internet have all been blamed. Business rates have become more vilified with charges currently linked to rental value at the top of the market in 2008 despite some rents falling by over 50% since then. Some argue that this has given an advantage to companies who operate solely on-line.\nEver since London’s Brent Cross opened in 1976, there have been concerns that large centres with free parking have had a negative effect on town centres. In the 1980s, government relaxation of retail sector planning policies coupled with increased car ownership meant more people were shopping in out-of-town centres: by the early-2000s nearly half of all food purchases were from out-of-town hypermarkets.\nThe conflict between free parking at out-of-town sites and a policy to significantly increase town centre parking charges to mitigate traffic problems in city centres may have had an all too predictable effect, particularly as out-of-town sites are able to increase the volume of free parking to manage demand, a challenge that is harder to meet in urban centres.\nThe internet is a disruptive technology, changing the face of entire industries in the blink of an eye. The share of internet sales is increasing at around 10% per year; 12% of all retail sales are now online and, for some segments, that share increases to over 60%. Even areas such as clothes and food are now seeing strong growth. Some businesses have balanced the “bricks and clicks” and see them as complementary to their high street presence showing that success in the internet age is possible, providing you get the business model right."

    "text": "Agglomeration’s (mostly) what you need\nBack in 2007, the British Council of Shopping Centres noted “… smaller town centres have not only been affected by out-of-town development but have also suffered the impact of the concentration of development within larger town centres.” This is crucially important. The recession exacerbated an existing problem, but it is the consumer that is driving the change in the retail world.\nShopping has become less of a refuel and restock process and has evolved into a complex mix where the boundaries of retail, tourism and leisure merge. The public seeks a wider experience and the places that benefit the most are those that provide it, merging shopping, eating and drinking, entertainment and wider visitor attractions into a single user journey.\nThere are exceptions: some smaller village centres are thriving. Places which offer a smaller-scale, bespoke service, focused on locality, individuality and often a non-corporate nature can do particularly well, and Greater Manchester has a number of these successful, smaller centres. Essentially, high street retail has been subject to the same forces as other businesses over the past decade: success can be found in high-volume, relatively low-margin and low cost stores and in lower-volume, higher-margin specialists who have a personal offer, but those in between are being ruthlessly squeezed.\nSome music stores in the UK were driven out both by iTunes and by smaller, specialist music and record stores; Tesco is feeling the pressure from Aldi and Lidl at the bottom, and Waitrose at the top. Appealing to everyone is hard for a single institution, but it’s possible in for a large agglomerative city centre to offer all the alternatives to suit everyone’s taste.\nManchester is undoubtedly one of those larger centres that has thrived and is well placed to take advantage of the recovery. To help embed that success, and build further upon it, it formed a new group to help it through."

Add the Intu Trafford Centre into that and our two key shopping areas account for around one pound in every three spent in retail across the whole of the North West. Manchester is the best performing city centre in the UK outside London with its regular commuters, workers and residents accounting for 40% of all spending. The changing demographics of the city with increasing numbers of people, particularly students and young professionals now living in the city centre means there is a larger captive audience who could be successfully engaged with the leisure provision, and it is partially this population that Manchester wanted to target more effectively in a new scheme."

    "title": "Retail in Manchester City Centre",
    "section": "Heart of Manchester BID",
    "text": "Heart of Manchester BID\nAfter consulting over 300 city centre retailers, in November 2012 a successful vote brought into being a five-year initiative: the Heart of Manchester Business Improvement District (BID). At the end of the BID’s first year, it is good to take stock of why it was set-up and what it hoped to achieve, reflecting on its first year and the challenges that lie ahead.\nThe BID’s primary objectives are to launch major new events in the city centre to attract footfall, develop a city centre hosts scheme to help and support visitors, cultivate a stream of activity to boost midweek and evening trade and to deliver significant promotional campaigns and partnerships to attract more affluent shoppers. These were designed to increase the overall attractiveness of the city centre to shoppers – both existing users and new visitors – repeat visits and provide a direct and tangible return on investment.\nIncreasing opening hours of the city centre stores and bringing new events into the city centre was seen as particularly crucial. When Manchester introduced late-night opening on Thursdays in 2005, it was clear there was demand, particularly from those who work and spend the day in the city, to stay into the evening for shopping and other activities. On other evenings, however, the city virtually closed at five o’clock. Simon Binns, manager of the Heart of Manchester BID, says: “the extended opening times of many of the city centre retailers through until eight o’clock has transformed the feel of the city in the evenings. Manchester now has a vibrant after-work culture in shops and bars every night of the week: it’s not just confined to say, a Thursday or Friday night. Today, the core retail areas are seeing significantly higher footfall and the city feels a much more vibrant area after work. Before this important commitment from retailers, Manchester suffered by seeing many of its 140,000 city centre employees head home straight after work, taking their discretionary spend with them. But now we’re seeing them not only stay in the evenings but return at the weekends with a significant increase in people coming into the city on Sundays, causing some retailers to look at staying open longer until 6pm. Capturing these additional visits gives Manchester a very different flavour: more cosmopolitan, more vibrant, a place to not just work or shop, but also linger and enjoy.”\nBut it takes more than just extended opening hours for shopping to convince people that staying after work is worth it. Manchester has its fair share of events, from the world-leading Manchester International and Jazz Festivals, the immensely successful Christmas Markets, as well as numerous smaller events, often located around the Town Hall on Albert Square, an area not synonymous with the city centre retail sector.\nThe near one million pounds raised each year through the participating members of the BID has gone a long way to delivering additional attractions. The first major event the BID helped to deliver was Dig the City, a new urban gardening festival pioneered by the Cathedral, in August 2013. With support from the National Trust, the City Council, Groundwork and the Co-operative Group’s NOMA, the traditionally quieter time in the retail calendar over summer counted over an additional one million visitors. The event increased footfall by over a quarter in New Cathedral Street and King Street and the city centre as a whole by more than 5% with half of all visitors doing additional shopping whilst there. Its success was deemed so strong that plans are already well advanced for a repeat of this nine-day event this year.\nOctober saw Manchester turned into a catwalk with Vogue Fashion’s Night Out coming to the city for the first time. Over 160 of the city centre’s retailers took part with thousands of visitors flocking not only to the direct events but also to extra late-night opening in the participating stores, doubling the footfall normally seen. What’s particularly important about events like this is that visitors are not constrained purely to the event venues themselves, but engage with the wider city centre proposition. During the Vogue fashion events, Manchester Arndale saw a 22% increase in footfall with 120,000 people using the centre on the main night.\nManchester Arndale understands the wider benefit that these big-piece city centre events have on its and its occupants’ fortunes. It is working closely with the BID team to ensure that it, too, is closely involved in the wider strategy. Featured in this month’s Behind the Scenes on pages 12-14, Manchester Arndale has done well through the recession and visitor numbers keep increasing with 2013 recording the second year in a row with over 41 million.\nThe centre is currently planning its annual October student event for the 11th year, focused around the new intake of students at the city’s universities. David Allinson, Centre Director at Manchester Arndale, takes up the story. “We’re home to Europe’s largest student population of around 100,000 and they can be seen as key to the success of the city centre, with one in five of our visitors being students. Changing demographics, such as many more international students with a higher spend profile and a desire to get to know everything that Manchester offers from a global viewpoint, means they are becoming ever more important to the city’s fortunes.\n“Our recent student spring event was hugely successful with live music, DJs and exclusive retailer offers. Alongside the October event we’re developing new ways of engaging the student population, particularly when students bring their wider families to the city to visit, such as through offers and social media. This is particularly important for international visitors as their spend profile is significantly higher.”\nAlongside this targeted engagement from retailers, the BID team is developing a user-friendly guide to the city and its shops, bars, theatres and museums, to make international family visits as easy and smooth as possible.\nDavid added, “Working integrally with the Heart of Manchester BID team is key to us and I think that the successes of the BID in its inaugural year demonstrates how bringing Manchester’s retailers together serves the city centre very well. We have worked closely with the BID to deliver hugely successful and profitable Vogue Fashion’s Night Out activity, as well as seasonal celebrations such as Chinese New Year and St Patrick’s Day and we have been thrilled by the results in terms of footfall and visitor engagement.”\nThe benefits don’t just flow to the bigger stores: small businesses benefit too. Manchester is home to a thriving independent retail sector (18% of all city centre businesses) – the largest share outside London. They benefit from the much higher footfall figures so the winnings are not just for the larger, paying members of the BID.\nThis was highlighted in the larger Chinese New Year celebrations of February 2014. With the city covered in 3,000 Chinese lanterns and special food markets across the city, the event was a showcase for Manchester’s long-established Chinese community. With visitor numbers up 20% on the previous year, city centre retailers saw an increase in sales of up to 125% on the main day of the festival with footfall up 59%.\nThe BID’s first year has shown what can be achieved when key partners come together to invest in the city and deliver a comprehensive offer to residents, workers and tourists alike. Retail sales and footfall have increased faster than the national average and total visitors to the city have increased by 14%. The Heart of Manchester BID has many additional events planned for its second year and beyond: for more information visit ."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This blog was first published in the Manchester Evening News on 29 July 2013.\nIt was reported in last week’s Manchester Evening News and in the national press that Justin King, chief executive at J Sainsbury, and his counterpart Dalton Philips at Wm Morrison have asked government to consider levying a tax on online sales.\nThey complain that there isn’t a level playing field between their bricks-and-mortar companies and those who trade mostly in the digital sphere. Chief executives of online firms such as Ocado and Greater Manchester’s own N Brown amongst others responded, rightly noting that this rather misses the point: the problem is not that online is under-taxed.\nRather, it is that traditional high street stores are overtaxed.\nAt the Chamber of Commerce we have been vocal for years about the horrendous burden of business rates on all sectors of the economy, but particularly on retail.\nHaving increased by 13 per cent over the past three years and linked to a property valuation at the height of the market in 2008, many businesses are now paying more in business rates than they are in rent.\nThis is a ludicrous position and, to make matters worse, the expected revaluation this year has been kicked two years down the road meaning those top-of-the-boom prices are locked into this tax for another 24 months.\nAn online retail sales tax also ignores the reality that many small- and medium-sized businesses, and particularly start-ups, are operating increasingly in the digital world. Depending on where any legislation drew the boundaries, you could see self-employed people and their eBay stores falling within the scope of this tax. It also fails to acknowledge that these large supermarkets are themselves seeing an ever-increasing share of their sales take place over the internet.\nThe future of online retail is strong and only likely to continue growing as a younger, apartment-dwelling, digitally-enabled population gets ever-more used to buying groceries via the web.\nFinally, the whole argument flies in the face of why more purchasing is taking place on line: it is more convenient, less expensive and places the buyer in charge of the when and where.\nThis shouldn’t need spelling out, but sadly it does: This Is A Good Thing. Civilisation as a whole moves forward by making steady improvements in efficiency, productivity and value. This means that we, the consumer, get to “live well for less” and “get more of what matters”. You’d think that the supermarkets more than anyone else would understand that."

    "text": "This blog was first published in an abridged format by British Chambers of Commerce in March 2017.\nWhilst nobody likes a tax, business rates is one that people love to hate. As a Fellow of British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) leading on the reform of business rates for two-and-a-half years, I’ve heard more nightmare stories from members than for any other issue, and have spent hours in rooms in Whitehall working through proposals with other business groups, local authorities, HM Treasury, the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) and the Valuations Office Agency (VOA). I often say, and only partially in jest, that I started a 12-month project over two years ago and think I may now be approaching the half-way point.\nThe history of business rates is a long one. Many know about the large changes to business rates that took place in 1990 under the Thatcher local government reforms when the level of rates was nationalised, but not many know that the system dates back a lot further: the Act for the Relief of the Poor 1601, passed under Elizabeth I, is the first piece of legislation.\nThere’s two other things from deep history I’d also like to reference here. Firstly, from the 17th-century, the words of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, minister of finance for King Louis XIV of France, and secondly, from the 18th-century, the wisdom of Scotland’s own father of economics, Adam Smith. Colbert said that “the art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to obtain the largest amount of feathers with the least possible amount of hissing”, and Smith laid out what he considered were fundamental principles of economic taxation: equity, certainty, convenience and economy. It is highly questionable whether the UK’s business rates system meets any of the above."

    "text": "How did the issue start?\nAs an issue, business rates really came to the fore after the recession. Commercial property prices tumbled as businesses struggled or failed, plenty a strong downward movement on rents. Companies were often able to renegotiate leases as supply increased and demand softened. But business rates were not only locked at their pre-recession level, remaining as a fixed percentage of the assumed market value of the property at the previous revaluation in 2003, but increased further in 2010 when business rates became a higher percentage of higher values, calculated against rents two years previously in April 2008, about as close to the top of the overheated market as it was possible to be. Wanting to minimise large changes to the rates payable, the scheduled revaluation for 2015 was delayed, giving the system another two years to become even more out of sync with the real world.\nIn April, the changes in the UK commercial property market since 2008 will be passed into the business tax system in one go (albeit with some limited transitional arrangements). The result of that has been clear in the press over the past few weeks, as the house of commons passed its Brexit bill and then ran off for half-term, allowing a media frenzy on rates to emerge with little comment from government ministers, showing that Colbert’s principle is being violated: the goose is hissing – loudly."

    "title": "The seven deadly sins of business rates",
    "section": "Calling for reform",
    "text": "Calling for reform\nWorking with its members, BCC developed seven key principles of the current system which require fundamental reform.\n\n1. Above the line\nBusiness rates is an input tax that it is payable regardless of turnover, profit, or ability to pay. Government policy is driving up input costs to businesses, whether through environmental taxes, increased minimum wages, auto-enrolment for pensions, higher employer national insurance or the forthcoming apprenticeship levy. At the same time, output taxes, particularly corporation tax, have been falling steeply, so revenue raised from business increasingly comes from the input side, burdening business regardless of its success. This violates Smith’s equity principle, that tax should be “… in proportion to their respective abilities, that is, in proportion to their revenue …”.\n\n\n2. Predictability of income\nBusiness rates is neither pro-cyclical or counter-cyclical. Instead, it’s how-much-would-you-like-to-raise-next-year-Mr-Chancellor-cyclical. The uprating of the national multiplier each year, currently at RPI but expected to change to CPI in 2020, means that government revenue from this tax on rental values increases every year, even if rental values fall. It has an in-built escalator, something that when applied to fuel infuriates everyone, but slips by here with little issue. It’s just about the only tax in HM Treasury’s army that does this and it’s hard to see why it should continue. Of course, it’s convenient for government, but meaningless for business. See the canon of certainty above for Smith’s view. Ours is that indexing should ideally be abolished entirely, allowing the system to flex with the market.\n\n\n3. Economically unresponsive\nThe slow frequency of revaluations (normally every five years, but currently seven) means rents and rates become disconnected over time. This can work in companies’ favour, and arguably that has happened in place like London since 2008, where rents have risen much faster than rates, but overall it means that areas with weaker property markets subsidies those with faster economic growth. In this sense, this partially violates Smith’s canon of certainty, where tax payable “… should be certain and not arbitrary”. A system which levies a percentage of what your property’s value was, or was thought to be at a previous time, is not ideal. The debates around Council Tax valuations go to the heart of this exact problem as well. Our view? Speed up the revaluations to keep up with the market, but you’ll have to change the system, because …\n\n\n4. Administrationally complex\nIt’s hard to get across just how bureaucratic this system is. If you operate a large site with a variety of uses, e.g. office space, toilets, kitchens, reception, warehouse, yard, factory, and have major plant and machinery including such modern-fripperies as air conditioning and micro generation, your valuation formula may not just run to dozens of line, but dozens of pages. An extra x% for one thing, subtract y% for another. It’s insane, and costs a fortune. It also generates a lot of appeals – the 2010 revaluation resulted in over a million appeals. When a system generates tax bills that nearly one-in-two payers feel the need to dispute, there’s something wrong. There are now so many appeals, that the back-log is nearly 300,000.\nEach of those businesses is required to pay these rates, every year, until the appeal is resolved or rejected, meaning many will pay more than they should up to seven years after the valuation was first arrived at. Smith’s third canon of convenience, that tax “…should be levied in such a manner … that it affords the maximum convenience to the tax payer”. It’s hard to see how this is convenient. Also, the costs of centrally valuing every property (and more besides), only to give 100% relief to around to one-third of them isn’t efficient. That’s why we’ve argued for a self-exemption for the bottom-third of properties. Just submit your lease details, show that it’s below the level, and nobody needs to visit you and measure how big your toilet space is. That helps us get in line with Smith’s canon of economy, too: the cost of collection should be a minimum.\n\n\n5. Perverse incentives\nThe administrational complexity caused by including productive investments in the valuation creates perverse incentives. Why improve your premises if you’re going to be taxed on the increase in value? Why invest in machinery if it will add to your tax bill at the next revaluation? And it also creates odd incentives on the recycling of government money. Want to follow government advice and decarbonise your energy supply to try and reclaim some of those environmental input taxes I mentioned earlier? Go ahead, and government will subsidise your investment through schemes available from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), but DCLG will come along later and tax you for doing so. So we have a system where BEIS levies taxes on your energy and then gives you subsidies to change your behaviour, but if you do, VOA will come and visit you to work out its value and ask DCLG to tax you on it. This does not meet any criteria of tax efficiency. See Smith’s canon number three.\n\n\n6. Disconnect between business and local government\nOne of the most common complaints about business rates is that companies simply don’t know what it’s there for or who receives it. “I don’t even get my bins emptied!” is a common response. Your local authority bills you, historically sending it all (now just half) to Whitehall who keep some then send it back to local authorities under a complex formula linked to deprivation and need. The system lacks significant transparency and the tax causes resentment between business and local government. The move to 100% retention by 2020 (though some areas will start a pilot this April) will set out a framework where this relationship could be improved, but it won’t happen on its own. For that to occur, there will need to be significant engagement between local authorities and their rate payers, and things like infrastructure levies may help, but there is a lot of work to do. It’s also questionable how much additional revenue full retention will allow for local government, but that shouldn’t stop this: the bigger principle here is restoring local accountability and both empowering spending decisions to be taken locally, and encouraging it to be done so openly.\n\n\n7. Large by comparison\nThis has been the big sticking point in reform. Government, as part of its ongoing fiscal consolidation, has insisted that any changes to business rates must be revenue neutral, i.e. however much it raises before the reforms, it must raise afterwards (plus indexation, of course). This means that the winners and losers are amplified, as the rules make this a zero-sum game. As government has been happy to cut revenue by lowering corporation tax, clearly this is not just a cash issue. The challenge, of course, is that business rates is so entwined in the local government finance system that large changes to revenue and the system overall would require large-scale reform of local government and local government finance. Eric Pickles, when Secretary of State for DCLG, said there was a pearl-handled revolver in his drawer for anyone who suggested such a thing. That gives you a pretty good idea of how interested government would be in genuinely tackling this properly, from the ground up.\nBut there’s another dimension to this which I suspect is where the blocks on radical reform come. Basically, it raises too much money. At £26bn, the UK raises a larger share of taxation from property taxes than any other developed economy, and around double the OECD average. That, combined with its complex twinning with local government, means even small changes can have a disproportionate effect on the spending power of town halls. Corporation tax can be changed easily as it goes to central government and mostly funds central spending so large changes can be absorbed. I fear that not only does the fiscal neutrality argument stop serious reform, it actually makes the matter worse. The larger the revenue share gets, the harder reform in the future becomes."

    "text": "Efficient tax theory\nThose are the key areas showing why we want reform, but there’s one last thing I want to touch on. There have been a number of economists over the past few weeks – mostly those I take seriously as good quality academics and practitioners of efficient tax theory and good quality public policy and who I often agree with – who have put forward the argument that business rates, as a tax on property value, is broadly efficient and has a number of good comparisons with a land value tax (LVT), something which many economists would ultimately prefer. Their argument often includes comments that increasing something’s value should increase the nominal amount of tax payable, and that, in its similarities to an LVT, broadly encourages economically efficient use of a finite resource like land.\nI feel that there are some elements of truth in this, but also that it mostly obfuscates, or entirely misses, the areas where the similarities to a LVT are weakest. Firstly, business rates is a tax on property value, not land value. That means the relationship is close, but not very, and varies hugely depending on the use of the property itself. The vagaries of valuing large sites on the central list such as power stations show how highly approximate this process can be. Secondly, plant and machinery is included in the valuation, which would have impacts on the property value but not the land value. This is the area where I feel the difference between business rates and an LVT is the largest and, in arguing for the removal of plant and machinery, we specifically included a comment that in doing so, you would allow the business rates system to operate in a way more closely related to an LVT. Finally, there are two ways of looking at a tax – deadweight costs of the system itself, and the level at which it operates.\nI’ve outlined above the problems with the first of these, that the system simply isn’t efficient, but the rate at which it is levied matters too. A key piece of economic tax theory – the Laffer curve – speaks directly to this in that there are optimum rates of taxation for both revenue raising and economic distortion. Here is where business rates, compared to either an LVT or to Council Tax – another example of a property value tax – sit as an outlier. No-one would countenance Council Tax or an LVT being set at the rate business rates currently are. The rate for 2017/18 is likely to be over 50%, meaning the tax take on property value is inordinately large. Combine this with the all too clear failings of the UK’s planning system to provide adequate land in the right areas with the right permissions, and you’re effectively levying one of the highest rates of tax in the UK economy on one of the most poorly designed systems with little ability to react to market conditions.\nPut all this together, and it’s no wonder that Colbert’s goose is hissing."

    "text": "Whether in business, academia or much else of the world. the first of September feels like the start of a new year. In schools, colleges and universities, preparations are being made for a new academic year and, with the rest of the world returning from what they hope have been long and restful holidays, attention is turned to new starts, new ventures, and the anticipation of a productive ‘push’ to the Christmas break.\nIt’s much the same for me. After changing jobs in April, moving from the business world to academia, I’ve spent my first few months beginning to understand what, for me, is a very different world from my previous employment, as well as realising that it shares many of the same hopes and challenges. The summer has been spent in a combination of reading, writing and, most recently, resting, and now, as attention turns to the unflux of nearly 40,000 students in a few weeks, I’m busy launching a new research unit, Future Economies Analytics, within my research centre and finally updating my own website.\nI’ll talk about this in more detail over the coming days, as well as pondering on some aspects of the UK economy that struck me during my holidays as I toured around parts of the country, but Future Economies Analytics will be a unique addition to the university sector research space, focusing on secondary micro-data analysis and forecasting for sub-regional economies across the UK.\nWhilst George Osborne’s ‘devolution revolution’ has slowed down over recent years and government grapples with Brexit, increasing attention continues to turn to cities, to towns, to rural areas; to transport connectivity that goes beyond city-to-city commutes and begins to understand the role of buses; to inclusive growth and the ‘left-behinds’; to the future of the UK outside the European Union; to what a local industrial strategy means; and, perhaps the biggest challenge, what type of economy should the UK and its constiteunt parts (both devolved nations and local government) seek to develop over the coming decade.\nFuture Economies University Research Centre at Manchester Metropolitan University, where I now work, is working on these and more questions, seeking to answer the core question “what are the challenges that future economies face, and how should policy makers respond to them?’. Within that, my team will be working on exitsing and innovative new datasets and cuting-edge statistical techniques to help answer these questions, and we’ll be publishing regularly with traditional academic papers, but also more accessible policy white papers, research documents, blogs and podcats, interactive charts, spatial mapping and live forecasting models.\nAll that’s to come but, for now, follow me personally on this website or on Twitter at @ChristianSpence. Future Economies Analytics tweets at @MMU_FEAnalytics, the wider research centre at @MMU_FutureEcon, and its (temporary: new one coming soon!) website can be found at www.mmu.ac.uk/research/our-research/future-economies. Future Economies will formally be launching later in the autumn and if you’d like to be kept up-to-date with developments and our news, contact me via any of the above and we’ll add you to our mailing list."

    "text": "This post comes on the back of an outstanding piece in Politico by Jack Blanchard. There’s lots worth reading there in full, but I want to dwell on the comments raised in Wigan and highlighted by Tom Forth in this tweet.\nWhilst lots has been written by both academics and policy advisors (think-tanks, etc.) about devolution and the importance of what more recently has become known as functional economic areas, the debate around place and identity and their relationship to governance has mostly been left to the academic world, meaning much of the detailed research and thinking lingers in journals and academic conferences and doesn’t permeate what I might call (and hope I can get away with it in my new role in academia) the real world.\nLisa Nandy (MP for Wigan) comments about the challenges of ruling elites and their distance from the people they serve. A number of authors have raised this as a key issue in the Brexit vote, that people feel disconnected from a ruling elite in Brussels, and would prefer one closer to home. I would argue that the problem has been a distance from the ruling powers in Westminster and Whitehall rather than Brussels, but that will have to wait for a future post.\nBut isn’t this a problem that devolution was meant to solve? After all, the good residents of Wigan have part of a more local government since the 1970s reforms, first in Greater Manchester Council, later through the voluntary working arrangements of the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities (AGMA), and most recently as a constituent of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority. The whole point of these reforms (at least the most recent – the 1970s reforms and their 1980s reversals are worth a entire suite of posts on their own) was to bring more power closer to the people, but if the population feels disenfranchised by these, then where to we go from here?\nHistory may help us out to some degree. The 1970s reforms took power away from smaller councils and passed it up to new districts and and an overarching metropolitan tier. In terms of direct democracy, it’s not clear that more power was given to either local areas, or to their voters to effect change. And it’s perhaps that latter point that’s where the disconnect may be the greatest.\nPower given if useless if it cannot be shaped. Wigan (and other boroughs like it across the country) have markedly fewer powers today to actively shape their places in response to the wishes of the local people. The democratic feedback loops are at best tarnished, and may be broken. There is little point in championing the powers that Greater Manchester now has (and they have noticeably increased) if the people of the boroughs do not feel as if they can shape them.\nWhilst this is in danger of sounding like a call for increased direct democracy, that’s not what I’m suggesting: that is an idea based in good intent but riven with challenges in its delivery (see Brexit for a recent example). But voters must be able to feel that they can influence and shape the fortunes of their place, and it’s not clear that the current model can do that.\nThe creation of the directly-elected mayors, whilst opposed by a majority, I think will, over the longer term, provide a useful tool in repairing the democratic deficit, but I suspect that the powers they currently hold are insufficient to enable that to happen on a scale that’s sufficient. The mayors will always be challenged by the image of ivory towers at city hall, but other places around the world have solved this with a far more extensive and sweeping powers at a local level than this country has seen in the past century or more, and arguably ever. (There’s another piece I must write on the history of sub-national governance in the UK and why it is so centralised, but that’s definitely for another day).\nSo, to come back to place and identity, this raises a final question for now: to where do places like Wigan see themselves as belonging? As someone who was born and brought up there, I hope I have a sliver of understanding about this. During the 1980s and 1990s when I lived there, it was clear that Wigan didn’t naturally look to Manchester as its neighbour, partner or bigger brother. Liverpool was a more natural urban parent, but Warrington and West Lancashire towns like Skelmersdale, Ormskirk, and even Preston, were mentioned more by the people I knew than Manchester ever was.\nThe 2001 census placed Wigan in the same Travel to Work Area (TTWA) as Manchester, and Greater Manchester, in these maps, was a near perfect fit for the mobility of its population. This changed in the 2011 data, when Wigan became paired with Warrington, and Greater Manchester gained Cheshire East and Macclesfield within its reach. Part of this is changing public transport availability, part is the phenomenally rapid growth of Warrington and Cheshire’s economies during the 2000s (again, worth a post on its own).\nWe shouldn’t worry about fitting governance structures exactly onto changing patterns like these, as the borders will be endlessly shifting. But identity is much less mobile, and representation within larger structures matters to individuals’ feelings of autonomy and the validity (real or perceived) of their governments.\nThis is where devolution can help, but we need a level of support from politicians, as policy can’t fix all the problems. In reality, Wigan is probably best served within the Greater Manchester structures, where the scale for investment, and for its returns, is greater. But in the end, the people of Wigan will need to feel they have adequate representation, and that their voice is heard equally with those of more prosperous and more vocal boroughs like Manchester.\nAndy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, has made clear that he wants to see greater representation of, and policy designed to benefit, the outlying areas which have seen relatively little investment compared to the city centre and wider urban core. But the challenge is that this mustn’t come as a form of jam-spreading, where spend is dictated solely on a per capita basis (I disagree with IPPR North and its policy recommendations for transport spend for the same reason – spending should be balanced more towards need than equity).\nRedistribution is important here, and will remain so for ever more, for no country is equal throughout. But in areas like Greater Manchester, where the whole does not generate net returns from which to distribute, this places a further challenge on the political messaging. Whether local spend is in Manchester or Wigan, it will ultimately be driven by money redistributed from somewhere else. But Greater Manchester as a whole is aiming to correct its fiscal balance, and balance its books over the coming decade. That will give the politicians greater leeway in taking distributive decisions.\nSo, for now, whilst policy can go someway to correcting the problem, it will take a long time for that to come (and fiscal devolution – the ability to raise and spend your own money – is critical to this). In the shorter term, the solution lies with politicians to create the narrative and lead the people. On a national scale, this is woefully lacking. At a local level, while it has a way to go, the signs are more positive."

    "text": "Speaking at the CBI conference yesterday (18 November 2019), prime minister Boris Johnson announced a “fundamental review” into business rates where the burden “will be reduced” if the Conservatives win a majority at the general election on 12 December. This was just one of a number of statements around proposed tax changes under a future Conservative government, including a postponing of the proposed cuts in corporation tax, but does what we have heard mean the Tories are taking a different approach to taxation?\nSecretary of State for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, Andrea Leadsom, appeared on Radio 4’s Today to trail the announcements, but her contributions, though closer to what could be described as a traditional Conservative view, were different in tone from that which Johnson perhaps surprisingly announced later that day.\nPromises of reviews into business rates are increasingly common: both Labour and Conservatives included some form of it in their 2015 and 2017 manifestos, and there were some timid reforms under the coalition government with partial retention of rates in 2013 as well as an attempt at wholesale reform from 2014 onwards, but little came of it through a combination of fear of reform within both the civil service and politicians, and the early 2017 election which caused the local government finance bill to fall. (Disclaimer: I was involved in a number of the committees for that process.)\nLeadsom noted that the government had already implemented some significant changes with a £13bn relief package target at the retail sector on the high street, but I would argue tinkering with reliefs is not that significant. Instead, a constant meddling of with reliefs tends to point to a more fundamental problem in the core system, as identified by the Treasury Select Committee’s report in August 2019.\nLeadsom continued to make her case for a more fundamental review in the next parliament, citing both the critical source of revenue that business rates provides for the Treasury (c. £30bn p.a.), and the unfairness of high rates on the high street compared with online businesses that need less expensive real estate from which to operate. Nick Robinson asked that, with business rates receipts forming around one-third of local government revenues, how councils would manage the revenue loss, or whether parts of the business community would pay more to close the fiscal gap. Leadsom’s reply was limited to restating a desire to review the entire system.\nPrevious evidence suggests this is hard, with politics causing at least as many headaches as the technical challenges of reform. The coalition government’s secretary of state for Communities & Local Government, Eric Pickles, said that there was a pearl-handed revolver in his desk for anyone who suggested local government reform, and a fundamental rebuilding of the business rates system from the bottom up would almost certainly require opening the Pandora’s box of local government administration and finance.\nBut what Leadsom said next was striking. She noted that, since the government had reduced the headline rate of corporation tax from 28% to 19%, there has been an increase in revenue of 45% collected by the exchequer from this tax, implying that this could also be true for business rates. Certainly corporation tax revenues have increased since 2010 when the rate started to be lowered, but this is more likely to be because the country was exiting a heavy recession. Instead, the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggests the lost income from these cuts amounts to billions per year:\n\nLeadsom was clear that she was not saying some business will pay more to help high streets, but it is unclear how this can be the case. The theory behind the cutting of corporation tax that the Conservative’s have clung to is that of the Laffer curve: that tax receipts will be zero at rates of both 0% (none collected) and 100% (that it’s not worth working), and that there is a peak somewhere between the two, and that lowering rates can increase revenue by broadening the base. The theory is heavily contested, but theoretically must, in some form, be true: the real question is where the optimal rate is.\nIt is not clear, however, that this would apply to business rates, as broadening the base is difficult: it needs either physical construction of property which is only ever marginal to the existing stock, or increasing the base by bringing more small properties back into scope, which is contrary to government policies over the past two decades. Whilst we can argue where the optimal tax rate is for corporation tax, it seems futile for a near unavoidable property tax. Lowering the burden will lower revenues, all other things being equal.\nAt the CBI conference later in the day, Johnson surprisingly announced that the scheduled cuts in corporation tax (to 17%) were to be postponed. Surprising, because this has been a key aspect of the Conservatives’ tax policy for nearly a decade. Even more surprising was the reason given: to ensure that there was more money to invest in public services.\nWhy is this so surprising? Because it’s the first time in decades that a Conservative prime minister or chancellor has admitted that tax cuts may depress government tax revenues. It’s an explicit acknowledgement that either they’re now having doubts about the Laffer Curve’s validity, or that they now believe that the UK may already be below the optimal rate. This is a significant change in thinking from this party, and leaves open questions about other policies from previous manifestos, including the level of tax-free personal allowances at both the basic and upper rate thresholds.\nAre the Conservatives losing faith in their low-tax model? Or are they just frightened that they can no longer sell it to the public? We’ll have to wait for the next Budget to know for certain."

This is still a substantial increase above where prices were before the invasion of Ukraine, and a large share of households will still require additional support above what has already been pledged to ensure that their energy bills remain affordable.\nThe decision to extend this cap to businesses will be a relief for many, however limiting this to just six months leaves significant uncertainty over planning for the coming year and may cause some challenges for businesses seeking to renegotiate annual contracts at this traditional time of year. We now have to wait for a review that will decide which sectors will fall under a definition of “vulnerable industries” that may receive additional support after the six month period. Government must aim to conclude this review as quickly as is practicable, and include business organisations closely in that process.\nGovernment has not estimated the cost of this intervention but it is likely to exceed £100bn with little to no clue as to how that will be financed. With significant tax cuts pledged to be announced at an emergency budget expected later this month, this is likely to place additional challenges on the public debt and also on interest rates. Whilst Sterling has responded positively to the news (and its strengthening will take some pressure off imported inflation), this is also because this additional boost to household incomes may well feed through into higher domestic inflation and cause the Bank of England to increase base rates faster than was previously expected.\nIt is welcome that the new government has moved quickly to reassure consumers and businesses on energy prices, but there is much missing from this statement that will need to be concluded swiftly over the coming weeks. Even with this price cap in place, consumer spending will remain under pressure and businesses will need further reassurance if they are to plan through into 2023 with confidence."

The UK is almost certainly already in recession and is likely to remain for at least another year. High inflation means household incomes are likely to fall by 7% over the next two years, a level not seen even during major recessions. That will reduce consumer spending and lower growth further in itself, though the confirmation of inflation-linked increases in benefits is hugely welcome.\nThe second serious problem is debt, which is increasing rapidly at a time when the cost of servicing debt is also increasing. The chancellor announced £55bn of consolidation, around 2% of GDP, split broadly equally between tax rises and spending cuts. The tax rises will mostly be achieved by every chancellor’s favourite sleight-of-hand, fiscal drag. Keeping personal allowances and tax bands frozen in cash terms out until 2028 means that everyone will pay a little more tax each year as more of their earnings fall outside the personal allowance or lower tax rates. At a time of high inflation, this an easy way to boost revenues without having to increase tax rates, which this government promised it wouldn’t do in its 2019 manifesto.\nThere were some explicit tax changes on the better off: the 45p additional rate of income tax will now kick-in at around £125,000 from April 2023 rather than £150,000 but raises less than £500m in its first year out of the £7bn of tax increases that begin in the spring. The Dividends allowance and Capital Gains Tax annual exempt amount are to be halved next year, then halved again in 2024, but again the results are small compared to the overall plan. The heavy lifting of getting more tax revenue will mostly be done through those fiscal drag measures that affect all of us.\nThough larger businesses will feel the pain through the increase of Corporation Tax from 19% to 25% and through the freezing of the threshold for employers’ National Insurance, smaller businesses with profits below £250,000 will continue to pay at 19%. All businesses will benefit from a freeze in the multipliers for business rates, while retail, hospitality and leisure businesses see their 50% relief which was due to end in March extended for a further year and increased to 75%. Changes to transitional relief arrangements will also support businesses through the revaluation which comes into force in April. While these temporary amendments to business rates are welcome, they further point to a scheme which, through these, is increasingly seen even by government itself as unsustainable in its current form, and is ripe for fundamental review.\nLevelling-Up gets a brief mention, with round two of those funds confirmed with at least the previous budget of £1.7bn to be allocated, though it’s worth noting that the effects of high inflation will erode this number, as it is already doing with projects from the first round that are now mid-delivery. It is, like that first round, entirely capital funding, though revenue support for local authorities looks better than expected with an increase in the rate by which councils may raise their rates and more generous grant funding, though again, high rates of inflation, increasing demands on social care and an outdated and regressive Council Tax system which should be reformed alongside business rates all adding to the pressure on revenues and spending.\nThe longer-term picture, despite some small real terms increase to departmental spending, remains one of high debt, high inflation, weak incomes and constrained investment. Capital investment, frozen in cash terms for the end of this decade and falling rapidly from its current 3% of GDP will further constrain the ability of the UK economy to grow in the future. The chancellor’s hands were at least somewhat tied by the actions of previous, albeit Conservative, administrations, but the lack of any signs of a desire to fundamentally change, or even attempt to change, the trend rate of growth in the economy will continue to make the country poorer than it needs to be over the longer term.\nThe chancellor and the government have just two years until the next election. They are going to be two of the most challenging years economically that this country has faced for decades. This statement suggests that they will go into the 2024 election on a manifesto of cutting public services. This seems unsustainable, and they will, for all our sakes, need to come back with a more ambitious vision for the UK instead of merely seeking to calm the seas of the financial markets. But they shouldn’t wait for that election: they should begin that path now."
